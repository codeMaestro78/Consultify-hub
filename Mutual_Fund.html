                        <h4>Introduction to Mutual Funds</h4>
                        <p>
                            Mutual funds offer a convenient and effective way for individuals to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities, managed by professional fund managers. Their importance lies in their ability to provide investors with access to a wide range of investment opportunities that might otherwise be difficult to achieve independently.

                            While mutual funds offer the potential for high returns, they also come with inherent risks. Market fluctuations, economic downturns, and changes in interest rates can impact the performance of mutual funds, leading to potential losses for investors.
